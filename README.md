     - Switch to the repo directory `cd todo`
   - Give the local repository an 'origin' that points to your repository.
     - `git remote add origin https://github.com/[your-account]/[your-repo].git` 
   - Push the local repository to your repository on github.
     - `git push --set-upstream origin main`

2. When you have finished the exercise, please provide a link to the new repository.

# Tasks

### Bug fixes
1. Bug fix: 'Prevent double submission'

### New features
1. Add new feature: 'Mark as completed'
   > As a user, I want the ability to mark my todo items as completed.
   1. Implement UI and API call to set an item as `completed`
   2. The completed date must be displayed in the UI, if the item is visible
2. Add new feature: 'Show completed items' 
   > As a user, I don't want to see my completed items unless I have chosen to do so.
   1. Implement UI and API call to show/hide completed items in the list view
   2. Completed items should not be shown by default

### Feature changes
1. Disable submit button if there is no text in 'Create new item'
1. Feature change: 'Item ordering'
   > As a user, I want to see the most recently created items at the top
2. Feature change: 'Make all items uppercase'
   > As a user, I want my item text to automatically convert to uppercase after I've submitted it

### Technical tasks
1. Add unit tests for new API logic
2. Remove any redundant code
